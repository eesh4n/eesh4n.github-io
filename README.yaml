description: >
  This repository contains the fully static version of the Oakridge DECA website — originally built in Django 
  and now converted into a clean, fast, and GitHub Pages-optimized static site. The conversion allows free hosting, 
  instant loading, and a custom domain (oakridgedeca.ca) with zero backend requirements.
